Sanjay Patel[11] (voiced by Maulik Pancholy)[12] is a 12-year-old Indian-American boy who goes on adventures with his best friend, Craig. He has a crush on Belle Pepper, who works at his favorite place to hang out, The Frycade. Sanjay attends Stuntman School and idolizes Remington Tufflips, a washed up action movie star from the 1980s. Sanjay tries to fit in most of the time and always enjoys his time with Craig.
Craig Slithers[11] (voiced by Chris Hardwick)[12] is Sanjay's anthropomorphic pet snake whom he met in a pet store. Craig is a so-called "master of disguise" — whether he is a doctor, a lawyer, or a beauty pageant queen, no one ever recognizes him. Only a few people know Craig can talk; Sanjay and his close friends keep it a secret. Craig does not like to be called just a pet.
Vijay Patel[11] (voiced by Kunal Nayyar)[6] is Sanjay's father and owns a clearance store in the neighborhood. He has invented various mechanicals, such as a party-obsessed, dancing robot, the Partybot.
 He also knows that Sanjay's pet snake Craig can talk.
Darlene Patel[11] (voiced by Grey Griffin)[6] is Sanjay's mother who works at a hospital as a nurse and a surgeon. She often tells Sanjay stories about her work. She also knows Sanjay's pet snake Craig can talk.
Belle Pepper (voiced by Nika Futterman) is a 16-year-old girl who works at the Frycade, Sanjay and Craig's favorite place to hang out. Sanjay has a crush on her, yet when he attempts to talk to her it does not work out. Even though she is a good friend of Sanjay, she rarely shows any signs of seeing him as her boyfriend, unlike Megan, who shows her passion constantly.

Hector Flanagan[11] (voiced by Matt Jones)[12] is Sanjay and Craig's weird eye patch-wearing friend. He can annoy them at times and has a crush on Megan.
Megan Sparkles[11] (voiced by Linda Cardellini)[12] is Sanjay and Craig's enthusiastic and overachieving friend who takes part in beauty pageants. Megan is a frequent beauty pageant winner who can get carried away at times, but loves helping Sanjay. She has an unrequited crush on Sanjay, although Sanjay does care about her as a friend.
The Dicksons[11] (voiced by Grey Griffin and Nolan North) are three siblings who have a hard rock band called the "Tuff Skulls". Their names are Sandy, Scabs, and Baby Richard. Sanjay and Craig appear to really like the Dicksons' music, and although the Dicksons look like bullies, they are mostly indifferent to Sanjay and Craig's adoration and would never intentionally harm them, though they can be very aggressive at times.
Mr. Leslie Noodman[11] (voiced by Tony Hale)[12] is Sanjay and Craig's psychotic neighbor who hates snakes. He has a pathological fear of them because of a prank his father pulled on him when he was young (his father actually pulls many pranks on him, thus, he hates his father). He loves his cat, Lady Butterscotch, but is Sanjay and Craig's number one enemy. He cares deeply for his award-winning blueberries and likes to use his shovel as a weapon. He seems to be aware about Craig and would go to great lengths to threaten him.

Remington Tufflips[11] (voiced by Chris D'Elia,[1] credited as "Remington Tufflips") is a washed-up action movie star from the 1980s who Sanjay and Craig idolize. To them, he is the raddest guy to ever walk on the face of the Earth. Despite his has-been status, Tufflips' ego and arrogance have swelled over the years, along with his waistline. To Sanjay and Craig, he is still the king of cool, in their adoring eyes. Although he is Sanjay and Craig's ultimate hero, he usually fails to remember their names.[13] In "Street Dogg", Tufflips was formerly a rapper before his movie career, and was in a band with Street Dogg (a parody of Snoop Dogg). In "Booyah for Bollywood", it is revealed that his real name was "Remington TuffFist", in which Sanjay and Craig (as well as TuffFist himself) were calling him his wrong name the whole time.
Brenda Dickson (voiced by Grey Griffin) is the mother of Sandy, Scabs and Baby Richard. Her husband is never seen or mentioned. She only communicates through grunting and snorting, but as revealed in "Enter Sandman", she can actually talk, but only when her children aren't around.
Tyson (voiced by David Hornsby) is a very rude and sarcastic young man who speaks in an English accent, and is Sanjay's primary rival for Belle's affections. He carries a scooter in his pants and often tries to ruin Sanjay's fun.

Ronnie Slithers (voiced by Nolan North) is a wealthy corn snake who is revealed to be Craig's long-lost brother and first appeared in "A Tail of Two Slithers". Ronnie's cruel tendencies have led Sanjay and Craig to believe that they are no longer the best of friends. He later joins Sanjay's side by revealing to his soldiers that he is a snake, and later gets returned to the pet shop, where he formerly lived with Craig before Sanjay found him. Ronnie makes a return in the series finale, "Booyah for Bollywood", where it is revealed that after his last encounter with his brother, Ronnie decided to live in India throughout a shipping box after feeling hopeless in finding a new owner. During his life in India, Ronnie learns to control his anger by practicing Yoga and Meditation, and later becomes a movie director.
Dolph Lundgren (voiced by himself) is the founder of the town the series took place in. He made his first appearance on-screen in the episode "Huggle Day", where he tries to search for Huggle Bunny and reveals to Sanjay and Craig on how he really founded Lundgren and Huggle Day. Before the events of the series, he became lost and cold in the middle of nowhere, then suddenly he was saved by Huggle Bunny and was given some shelter. But he has failed to pay him back thanks to the greed of the citizens of Lundgren.
